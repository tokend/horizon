  title: Horizon
  description: |
    Horizon is the client-facing REST API module that consumes data from the core of the system and makes it more convenient to use the
    client facing application. It allows submitting transactions to the network,
    reading history of operations, and checking the state of entities.

    > IMPORTANT: Note that endpoints not specified in this document or marked as `WIP` do not guaranty the backwards compability maintenance.

    ### Overview
    Horizon uses [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) convention to format requests and responses.
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>).
    ### Security
    TokenD uses the Ed25519 algorithm for authorizing any request or read private data. The use of such cryptographic proof allows building a system where transfer of secrets in an open form is not necessary, which significantly improves the security. Thus, an attacker who has access to one of the servers will not be able to compromise users' secrets.

    Request signature implementation is based on IETF HTTP Signatures draft RFC. Implicit headers parameter is not supported; clients must explicitly specify headers used for signing.

    The signature algorithm supported is ed25519-sha256, which uses public signer key as `keyId`.

    Both Signature and Authorization HTTP authentication schemas are supported.

    The minimum recommended data to sign is the (request-header) and date.

    For the following request:

    ```http
    GET /users?type=2 HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.tokend.io
    Date: Fri, 05 Jan 2018 21:31:40 GMT
    ```

    Signing string would be:

    ```text
    date: Fri, 05 Jan 2018 21:31:40 GMT
    (request-target): get /users?type=2
    ```

    > Note that header names and HTTP method are lowercased.

    The next step is to convert the signing string to a byte array using `UTF-8` encoding and to take its `SHA-256` hash.

    For the signing string above, hash would be:
    ```text
    6fcbee4b0a8932784644d33b360bd3eef389ed37dfd66f17e4bfa910ba9d616a
    ```

    Now, you have to sign hash with a private key and encode the result in `Base64`. For a seed such as `SCDMOOXVNMO6SA22AYUMZDIGLDJMBUTVEGB73FFNTLFJILBJWIU4NQ3D`, the encoded signature would be:

    ```text
    w/y3EsliTmQPC6MS88N/kjU/hFVxlIdhFhzfRGv4yIsSokgMpxVqxcC/CmUsAN4t3BKpskGG7+JEWryV8NXvCg==
    ```

    The result HTTP header included to the request then would be:


    ```text
    Authorization: keyId="GBLTOG6EJS5OWDNQNSCEAVDNMPBY6F73XZHHKR27YE5AKE23ZZEXOLBK",algorithm="ed25519-sha256",signature="w/y3EsliTmQPC6MS88N/kjU/hFVxlIdhFhzfRGv4yIsSokgMpxVqxcC/CmUsAN4t3BKpskGG7+JEWryV8NXvCg==",headers="date (request-target)"
    ```

                  * A base asset refers to the underlying assets giving value to a company, investment or loan.
                  Base asset is not fixed. It will appreciate or depreciate according to market forces.
                  * A quote asset refers to the last amount at which 1 base asset was traded,
                  meaning the most recent price to which a buyer and seller have agreed as well as the price
                  at which some 1 base asset was transacted
