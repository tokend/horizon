                  Allows getting `Account` with corresponding details.\n
                  Note that if we include `fees` filter - we will receive all the fees applied to a particular account.\n
                  For example if someone's, say Bob, account has a several fees applied to itself:
                    * first fee applied globally for all accounts for payments of amount from 0 to 100 `BTC` and is 1% from the payment
                    * second fee applied exactly to Bob's account and is 2% of the payment of amounts from 100 to 200 `BTC`\n
                  then we will receive both of them in response because they are applied to Bob's account
